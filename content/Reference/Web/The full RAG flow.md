## Step 1: Chunk Your Source Text

First, we take our source document and break it into manageable chunks. For this example, we'll use two simple text sections:

- Section 1: Medical Research - "This year saw significant strides in our understanding of XDR-47, a 'bug' we have not seen before."
- Section 2: Software Engineering - "This division dedicated significant effort to studying various infection vectors in our distributed systems"

## Step 2: Generate Embeddings

Next, we convert each text chunk into numerical embeddings using an embedding model. To make this easier to understand, let's imagine we have a perfect embedding model that always returns exactly two numbers, and we know what each number represents.

In our imaginary model:

- The first number represents how much the text talks about the medical field
- The second number represents how much the text talks about software engineering

For the medical research section, we might get `[0.97, 0.34]` - very medical-focused but with some software elements due to the word "bug". For the software engineering section, we get `[0.30, 0.97]` - heavily software-focused but with medical undertones from "infection vectors".

## Normalization

The embedding API typically performs a normalization step that scales each vector to have a magnitude of 1.0. You don't need to worry about the math here - it's handled automatically. This gives us normalized vectors like `[0.944, 0.331]` and `[0.295, 0.955]`.

We can visualize these embeddings on a unit circle, where each point represents one of our text chunks.

## Step 3: Store in Vector Database

We store these embeddings in a vector database - a specialized database optimized for storing, comparing, and searching through long lists of numbers like our embeddings.

![](https://everpath-course-content.s3-accelerate.amazonaws.com/instructor%2Fa46l9irobhg0f5webscixp0bs%2Fpublic%2F1748542287%2F07_-_004_-_The_Full_RAG_Flow_09.1748542287378.jpg)

At this point, we pause. All the work so far has been preprocessing that happens ahead of time. Now we wait for a user to submit a query.

## Step 4: Process User Query

When a user asks a question like "I'm curious about the company. In particular, what did the software engineering dept do this year?", we run their query through the same embedding model.

![](https://everpath-course-content.s3-accelerate.amazonaws.com/instructor%2Fa46l9irobhg0f5webscixp0bs%2Fpublic%2F1748542287%2F07_-_004_-_The_Full_RAG_Flow_10.1748542287773.jpg)

This query gets embedded as something like `[0.1, 0.89]` - low medical score, high software engineering score. After normalization, we get `[0.112, 0.993]`.

## Step 5: Find Similar Embeddings

We send the user's query embedding to our vector database and ask it to find the most similar stored embeddings.

![](https://everpath-course-content.s3-accelerate.amazonaws.com/instructor%2Fa46l9irobhg0f5webscixp0bs%2Fpublic%2F1748542288%2F07_-_004_-_The_Full_RAG_Flow_12.1748542288192.jpg)

The database returns the software engineering section because it's the closest match to what the user asked about.

## How Similarity Works: Cosine Similarity

The vector database uses cosine similarity to determine which embeddings are most similar. This measures the cosine of the angle between two vectors.

![](https://everpath-course-content.s3-accelerate.amazonaws.com/instructor%2Fa46l9irobhg0f5webscixp0bs%2Fpublic%2F1748542288%2F07_-_004_-_The_Full_RAG_Flow_15.1748542288516.jpg)

Key points about cosine similarity:

- Results range from -1 to 1
- Values close to 1 mean high similarity
- Values close to -1 mean very different
- 0 means perpendicular (no relationship)

In our example, the cosine similarity between the user query and the software engineering chunk is 0.983 - very high similarity. The similarity with the medical research chunk is only 0.398 - much lower.

## Cosine Distance

You'll often see "cosine distance" in vector database documentation. This is simply calculated as `(1 - cosine similarity)`. With cosine distance:

- Values close to 0 mean high similarity
- Larger values mean less similarity

This adjustment makes the numbers easier to interpret in many contexts.

## Step 6: Create the Final Prompt

Finally, we take the user's question and the most relevant text chunk we found, combine them into a prompt, and send it to Claude for a response.

![](https://everpath-course-content.s3-accelerate.amazonaws.com/instructor%2Fa46l9irobhg0f5webscixp0bs%2Fpublic%2F1748542288%2F07_-_004_-_The_Full_RAG_Flow_19.1748542288831.jpg)

The prompt might look like:

```
Answer the user's question about the financial document.

<user_question>
How many bugs did engineers fix this year?
</user_question>

<report>
## Section 2: Software Engineering
This division dedicated significant effort to studying various infection vectors in our distributed systems
</report>
```

And that's the complete RAG pipeline! The system successfully retrieved the most relevant information based on semantic similarity and provided it as context for generating an accurate response.
